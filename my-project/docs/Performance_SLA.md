Performance_SLA.md - Runtime Guarantees
Overview
This document outlines the performance Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the Ad-Pod Stitching Server Optimization application, ensuring it meets scalability and efficiency requirements.
Key SLAs

End-to-End Runtime: <=30 seconds for max scale (1,000 servers, 50,000 DMAs) on 8-core VM (16GB RAM).
Memory Usage: <=8GB peak for max scale (use float32, avoid full matrices if >10M entries).
Clustering: O(M log M) per K, with 10-20 K samples.
MILP Solve: <=25s timeout per K, using CBC (free, efficient for reduced problem ~500 clusters).
Distance Computation: Vectorized with cdist, O(N*M) but <5s for max.

Optimization Strategies

NumPy vectorization for distances/aggregations.
Sample K in log-space (e.g., 10 values).
Parallelize K-loop if needed (multiprocessing.Pool).
Fallback: If timeout, use best partial solution.

Monitoring

Profile with timeit/cProfile in tests.
Log timings: e.g., "Clustering took X s".
Tests: Assert runtime < threshold for samples.

These guarantees ensure reliable performance.
